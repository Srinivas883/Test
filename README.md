# Tripadvisor Clone (Frontend Only)

A clone of the **Tripadvisor** website created using **HTML** and **CSS**. This project focuses on replicating the frontend layout and styling, showcasing various web development techniques for a responsive and visually appealing design.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Utilized **Flexbox** extensively to create a flexible and responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Image Transformations**: Applied the `transform` property to add dynamic tilting effects to certain images.
- **Interactive Buttons**: Implemented **hover effects** to change the color of buttons, enhancing user interactivity.
- **Semantic HTML Structure**: Properly used **header tags** (`h1` to `h6`) to create a meaningful and accessible content structure based on text size and hierarchy.
- **Advanced Positioning**: Leveraged **absolute** and **relative positioning** to overlay text and position PNG images precisely over other elements.
- **Gradient Overlays**: Added gradient effects to provide visual depth and improve text readability over images.
